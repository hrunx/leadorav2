# üö® **COMPREHENSIVE ERROR REPORT FOR EXPERT CONSULTATION**

## **CURRENT ISSUES - ALL PROBLEMS FOUND**

After implementing all the expert recommendations, we still have critical issues that need expert guidance to resolve all at once.

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #1: 504 Gateway Timeout**

### **Error:**
```
HTTP/2 504 Gateway Timeout
Content-Length: 0
```

### **Details:**
- **What:** The main orchestrator function times out after 30 seconds
- **Where:** `/.netlify/functions/agents-orchestrator`
- **When:** Every attempt to run the complete flow
- **Impact:** No agents execute, complete system failure

### **Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://leadora.net/.netlify/functions/agents-orchestrator \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_id":"d99d0d4e-04c3-4480-9e32-618ffa7ad4ea","user_id":"0f63cc8c-03b0-4d4c-bddf-0c7ccecc7edb"}' \
  --max-time 30
```

### **Result:** 504 timeout with no response body

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #2: Individual Agent Tests Also Timeout**

### **Error:**
- Empty response (no output)
- Functions appear to hang indefinitely

### **Details:**
- **What:** Even individual agent execution tests timeout
- **Where:** `/.netlify/functions/test-individual-agents` with `exec-business-personas`
- **Impact:** Suggests the issue is at the agent level, not orchestration level

### **Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://leadora.net/.netlify/functions/test-individual-agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test_type":"exec-business-personas"}' \
  --max-time 30
```

### **Result:** Empty response, function hangs

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #3: No Error Logging**

### **Problem:**
- API usage logs are empty (`[]`)
- No errors being captured in our logging system
- Functions are silently failing/hanging

### **Details:**
- **What:** Complete lack of error visibility
- **Where:** `api_usage_logs` table and function logs
- **Impact:** Cannot debug what's actually failing

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #4: Potential OpenAI Agent SDK Problems**

### **Suspected Issues:**

#### **A. Function Timeout Configuration**
- Netlify functions have 10-second default timeout
- OpenAI API calls might be taking longer
- No timeout handling in agent execution

#### **B. OpenAI API Quota/Rate Limiting**
- Using OpenAI API key with unknown limits
- Multiple simultaneous agent calls might be hitting rate limits
- No rate limiting handling implemented

#### **C. Agent SDK Configuration**
- `setDefaultOpenAIClient(openai)` might not be working in bundled environment
- Agents might be trying to use wrong endpoints
- Schema validation might be failing silently

#### **D. Memory/Resource Issues**
- Agents loading large models/contexts
- Function running out of memory
- No resource monitoring

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #5: Schema Validation Still Problematic**

### **Last Known Schema Error:**
```
400 Invalid schema for function 'storeBusinessPersonas': 
In context=('properties', 'personas', 'items'), 'required' is required to be supplied 
and to be an array including every key in properties. Missing 'locations'.
```

### **Details:**
- Even after adding `additionalProperties: false`
- Even after fixing required fields
- OpenAI's strict schema validation is extremely demanding

---

## **üî¥ ISSUE #6: Environment/Deployment Issues**

### **Potential Problems:**

#### **A. Environment Variables**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` might not be set correctly in Netlify
- Other API keys might be missing or incorrect

#### **B. Netlify Function Configuration**
- Function bundling might be incorrect
- Node version compatibility issues
- Memory/CPU limits being exceeded

#### **C. Import Resolution**
- Despite dynamic imports, the bundled code might still have issues
- OpenAI SDK might not be bundling correctly

---

## **üìã COMPLETE ERROR SUMMARY FOR EXPERT**

### **1. Primary Issue:**
**504 Gateway Timeout** - Functions hang and timeout instead of executing

### **2. Secondary Issues:**
- No error logging/visibility into what's failing
- Schema validation errors with OpenAI's strict mode
- Potential rate limiting or quota issues
- Memory/resource consumption problems

### **3. What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Function deployment and loading
- ‚úÖ Basic API tests (Serper, DeepSeek work individually)
- ‚úÖ Database connections
- ‚úÖ Search creation

### **4. What's Failing:**
- ‚ùå Any OpenAI Agent execution
- ‚ùå Complete orchestrator flow
- ‚ùå Individual agent tests
- ‚ùå Error reporting/logging

### **5. Architecture:**
```
Frontend ‚Üí Netlify Function ‚Üí OpenAI Agents (gpt-4o-mini) ‚Üí Tools (DeepSeek/Gemini/Serper) ‚Üí Database
                ‚Üë
            FAILING HERE

## **üéØ EXPERT CONSULTATION NEEDED**

### **Questions for Expert:**

1. **Timeout Handling:** How to configure Netlify function timeouts for long-running agent operations?

2. **OpenAI Rate Limits:** What rate limiting/quota considerations for gpt-4o-mini with multiple concurrent agents?

3. **Error Handling:** How to add comprehensive error logging for OpenAI Agent SDK failures?

4. **Schema Validation:** How to handle OpenAI's strict schema validation requirements?

5. **Performance:** How to optimize agent execution to prevent timeouts?

6. **Environment:** Any specific Netlify deployment considerations for OpenAI Agents SDK?

7. **Alternative Approaches:** Should we switch to direct OpenAI API calls instead of the Agents SDK?

## **üöÄ GOAL**

Get expert guidance to solve **ALL** these issues in one comprehensive fix, so we can deploy a working system without multiple test-and-fix cycles.

**The infrastructure is solid, but the OpenAI Agent execution is completely failing.** We need expert insight into what's causing the timeouts and how to resolve all issues at once.
