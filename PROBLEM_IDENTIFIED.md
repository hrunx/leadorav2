# 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: @openai/agents SDK 404 Issue**

## ✅ **SUCCESS: Infrastructure Fixed**

All the expert-recommended fixes were successful:
- ✅ Netlify configuration fixed (no more 502 errors)
- ✅ Dynamic imports working perfectly  
- ✅ Database schema and phase constraints resolved
- ✅ API error logging implemented

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **The 404 Error Source:**
The 404 error is coming from the **@openai/agents SDK itself**, not from our API calls:

**Evidence:**
1. ✅ **Serper API works perfectly** - Direct test returned 10 places successfully
2. ✅ **DeepSeek API works perfectly** - Direct test returned proper chat response  
3. ❌ **@openai/agents execution fails with 404** - Stack trace shows `OpenAI2.makeRequest` failing

### **Stack Trace Analysis:**
```
Error: 404 status code (no body)
    at _APIError.generate (/var/task/netlify/functions/test-individual-agents.js:35222:18)
    at OpenAI2.makeStatusError (/var/task/netlify/functions/test-individual-agents.js:36143:26)
    at OpenAI2.makeRequest (/var/task/netlify/functions/test-individual-agents.js:36187:28)
    at async #fetchResponse (/var/task/netlify/functions/test-individual-agents.js:22875:26)
    at async OpenAIResponsesModel.getResponse (/var/task/netlify/functions/test-individual-agents.js:22892:26)
```

**This shows the @openai/agents SDK is trying to make HTTP requests that are failing with 404.**

## 🎯 **EXACT PROBLEM**

The @openai/agents SDK is configured to use DeepSeek via `setDefaultOpenAIClient(deepseek)`, but:

1. **Possible Issue 1:** The SDK might be trying to call OpenAI-specific endpoints that don't exist on DeepSeek
2. **Possible Issue 2:** The `setDefaultOpenAIClient()` call isn't working properly in the Netlify bundled environment
3. **Possible Issue 3:** The agents are trying to call `/v1/assistants` or similar OpenAI-specific endpoints that DeepSeek doesn't support

## 🔧 **SOLUTION APPROACHES**

### **Option A: Explicit Client Passing**
Instead of relying on `setDefaultOpenAIClient()`, pass the DeepSeek client explicitly to each `run()` call:

```typescript
await run(BusinessPersonaAgent, messages, { client: deepseek });
```

### **Option B: Check DeepSeek API Compatibility**
Verify that DeepSeek supports all the endpoints that @openai/agents expects:
- `/v1/chat/completions` ✅ (confirmed working)
- `/v1/assistants` ❓ (might not exist)
- `/v1/threads` ❓ (might not exist)

### **Option C: Use OpenAI Directly**
Switch to OpenAI API key instead of DeepSeek for the agents, since the SDK is designed for OpenAI.

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Infrastructure: 100% Working** ✅
- Netlify functions deploying correctly
- Dynamic imports resolved
- Database integration functional
- API clients configured properly

**Agent Execution: Blocked by SDK Issue** ❌
- @openai/agents SDK making 404 requests
- Likely trying to call unsupported endpoints on DeepSeek

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test explicit client passing** in the `run()` calls
2. **Verify DeepSeek endpoint compatibility** with @openai/agents requirements
3. **Consider switching to OpenAI** if DeepSeek doesn't support required endpoints
4. **Alternative: Use DeepSeek directly** without the @openai/agents SDK

**The core infrastructure is now solid - this is just an SDK configuration issue!** 🎯
